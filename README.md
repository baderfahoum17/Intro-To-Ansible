# Intro-To-Ansible

## Getting my Dirty with Ansible - 
### first hands on experince

this repo is mainly to document my first experince with Ansible 



---
the Basics: 

##### Why?:
As a DevOps or Someone who work in IT.
There will probably be a lot of repetitive tasks in our environment such as:
> 1. Creating new hosts or virtual machines everyday
> 2. applying new configuration on those machines 
>3. patching on a dozen of servers
>4. there will be a time when we will have to migrate from one version to a new one
>5. deploying applications
>6. one that is overlooked usualy: performing securit compliance audits

^^
these tasks involve execution of hundereds of commands on hundereds of different servers


> we can automate these tasks with scripts but those scripts require regular maintance and alot of time to put them together

**ANSIBLE** to the rescue!
Ansible is a powerfull IT automation tool that can help with the automation even of the most complex of deployments with relative ease with only a few lines of instructions in an ==ansible automation playbook==

...

this repo will demo a creation of a LAB environment via VirtualBox
in order to deomnstrate some of Ansible powerful capabilites 

we will be creating a Template of a OS to create 3 virtual machines 
One as a Ansible control Machine
Two other machines to taget for configuration changes
